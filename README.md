# Physics Statistical Analysis Tool

## Description

The Physics Statistical Analysis Tool is a Python program that assists physics students in conducting statistical analysis of experimental data. It allows users to input datasets, perform various statistical calculations, and perform hypothesis tests (one-sample t-test, two-sample t-test, and chi-squared test) to make informed decisions about their experiments.

## How to Run the Program

1. download this repository

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you've saved the program.

3. Run the program by executing the following command:

python physics_statistical_analysis.py

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your data and perform statistical analysis.

## Statistical Calculations

### Mean

The program calculates the mean (average) of the input dataset.

### Standard Deviation

The program calculates the sample standard deviation of the input dataset.

### Variance

The program calculates the variance of the input dataset.

### One-Sample T-Test

For one-sample hypothesis testing, the program calculates the t-statistic to determine if the sample mean is significantly different from a hypothesized population mean.

### Two-Sample T-Test

For two-sample hypothesis testing, the program calculates the t-statistic to compare the means of two datasets and determine if they are significantly different.

### Chi-Squared Test

The program performs a chi-squared test to determine the goodness of fit between observed and expected values in a dataset.

## Examples

- Calculate the mean, standard deviation, and variance of a dataset.
- Perform a one-sample t-test to determine if the sample mean is significantly different from a hypothesized population mean.
- Perform a two-sample t-test to compare the means of two datasets.
- Perform a chi-squared test to check the goodness of fit between observed and expected values.
